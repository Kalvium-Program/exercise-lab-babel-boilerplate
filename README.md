Your task is to enhance the display of planet names using the pipeline operator and Babel's pipeline operator preset (pipeline-op). You need to work with both html and js files.

Important Note: The pipeline operator (|>) is not natively supported in browsers and requires Babel's preset (pipeline-op) to function properly.
